1. Create a directory for the MEME.
2. Extract the archive file into this directory.
3. Change to the above-mentioned directory.
4. You can start MEME from a terminal with the following command:
	java -Xmx512m -Djava.library.path=./lib/j3d -javaagent:%MEME%\lib\aspectjweaver.jar -jar MEME.jar (On Linux use java -Xmx512m -Djava.library.path=./lib/j3d:./lib/linux/x86 -javaagent:%MEME%\lib\aspectjweaver.jar -jar MEME.jar instead).

Notes:

a, Use full path of java if the command above doesn't work.
b, The MEME needs java version 1.6 or higher to run properly.
c, The Xmx switch increases the MAXIMUM heap size to 512 Mb (usually the application uses only 10-50 Mb heap memory). This should be optimal if your computer has at least 1 Gb RAM. If your
   machine has only 512 Mb RAM, you would decrease this amount to 256. In this case use the following command: java -Xmx256m -jar MEME.jar
d, The application doesn't tested in MAC, but the most of the program is written in platform-independent way. If you encounter any problem or error
   please send an e-mail to the following address: mass@aitia.ai or mass-support-request@lists.mass.aitia.ai
   If you send and error report, please include the MEME.log file from the directory of MEME, and also describe the steps that you
   have taken in the program before the error occurred.
e, Known issue: On MAC, you couldn't access the documentation inside the MEME, but you can find the documentation files in pdf format in the
   Documentation directory.
f, The above MEME installation operates under the assumption that you have Repast J
   3.x installed on your computer.
